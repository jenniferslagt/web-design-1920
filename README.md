## Exclusive Design principles
We actually design websites for people who use their computers in a similar way as we do. But this isn't enough if we want to design interfaces for people who are excluded. Creating inclusive websites enables people with disabilities to lead a more independent life. What if we design websites for real people with real disabilities? This is where the exclusive design principles are getting important. I wrote something in my [wiki](https://github.com/jenniferslagt/web-design-1920/wiki/Exclusive-Design-Principles) about this. This is how I added the design principles:

<details>
  <summary><b> 1. Study situation </b></summary>
<br>
I have to understand the context of Larissa's situation. Larissa is blind, so it's important for me to understand which devices she uses to visit a website. Most of the time, she uses a screenreader, a keyboard (or a  braille to read something). She can also read some big letters if there is a good contrast, but she prefers to use the screenreader or keyboard.

So it's important for me to understand how a screenreader works! A screenreader reads something that is "focused". Larissa can navigate by using her keyboard (usually the tab). She uses a screenreader called JAWS. There is a lot of information on the internet about this.

Larissa uses her phone or her computer to check her sport schedule.

  <summary><b> 2. Ignore conventions </b></summary>
<br>
We should actually use conventions that people know, but this doesn't work for Larissa. I should design from a different point of view. If you use a screenreader, you actually don't want to much content on the page. The screenreader will make too much noise and it will take too much time. So I have to make the page as minimalistic as possible. The screenreader should only read what's the important. But what is important?

  <summary><b> 3. Prioritise identity </b></summary>
<br>
What If we let people with disbalities play an active role in the design process? It's important to design <b>with</b> people! So Larissa is actually not only my "target audience", but also my co-designer! 
In this way, it's important to think about what content must be on the page. What does Larissa want to <i>hear</i>?

You can also use someone's personality to enhace the user experience. Larissa is very sportive! She does cycling and horse riding at a very high level. She represented the Netherlands at the 2016 Summer Paralympics and became with her sighted pilot world champion! But Larissa actually likes the game more than the cycling part. But she does like horse riding.

  <summary><b> 4. Add nonsense </b></summary>
<br>
You can add nonsense to make something more interesting and more fun. Think about the monotone voice of a screenreader. It's actually very silly, isn't it? I thought about some things that can make it more fun:
* Maybe I can apply a foreign accent the screenreader.
* Maybe I can make it more personal by making a screenreader more "human". 
* Maybe I can add something else than audio. Think about your phone that vibrates when you get a message.
